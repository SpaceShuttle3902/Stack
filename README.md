# Data Structures
## Assignment 2 Q2

Data Structures assignment. The purpose of this homework is to create a stack class with multiple functions.

The first step is to download all the relatable files: Stack.h , stack.cpp , main.cpp
From there you will run the program through whichever compiler you have access to and multiple options will be available for you

You will be running your code by making edits in the main.cpp file  as shown below:
![Stack_Run](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39e2529b-0a51-4c24-bfd6-97492f382c88)
You are given multiple options such as pushing a number to the stack, displaying a stack, removing an element, and checking if the stack is empty. The syntax to do this is provided, you will just need to change the numbers, for example: my_stack.push(3) pushed the integer 3 into a stack. The only change we made was to switch the number within the parenthesis. For finding the average, checking if the stack is empty, and removing the top integer all you have to do is call the function, ex: std::cout << my_stack.top() << std::endl;

The order to implement things is of course from top to bottom as shown, and here are the results:
